# Spice ðŸŒ¶, a spicy cross-platform UI framework!

A prototype (and design) of API minimalism for mobile.

If you like this idea, star for approval! Read on for details!

## Getting Started

Simply install the template:

```sh
dotnet new install Spice.Templates
```

Create either a plain Spice project, or a hybrid "Spice+Blazor" project:

```sh
dotnet new spice
# Or if you want hybrid/web support
dotnet new spice-blazor
```

Or use the project template in Visual Studio:

![Screenshot of the Spice project template in Visual Studio](docs/vs-template.png)

Build it as you would for other .NET MAUI projects:

```sh
dotnet build
# To run on Android
dotnet build -f net8.0-android -t:Run
# To run on iOS
dotnet build -f net8.0-ios -t:Run
```

Of course, you can also just open the project in Visual Studio and hit F5.

## Startup Time & App Size

In comparison to a `dotnet new maui` project, I created a Spice
project with the same layouts and optimized settings for both project
types. (`AndroidLinkMode=r8`, etc.)

App size of a single-architecture `.apk`, built for `android-arm64`:

![Graph of an app size comparison](docs/appsize.png)

The average startup time of 10 runs on a Pixel 5:

This gives you an idea of how much "stuff" is in .NET MAUI.

In some respects the above comparison isn't completely fair, as Spice
ðŸŒ¶ has very few features. However, Spice ðŸŒ¶ is [fully
trimmable][trimming], and so a `Release` build of an app without
`Spice.Button` will have the code for `Spice.Button` trimmed away. It
will be quite difficult for .NET MAUI to become [fully
trimmable][trimming] -- due to the nature of XAML, data-binding, and
other System.Reflection usage in the framework.

## Background & Motivation

In reviewing, many of the *cool* UI frameworks for mobile:

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* [Fabulous](https://fabulous.dev/)
* [Comet](https://github.com/dotnet/Comet)
* An, of course, [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/maui)!

Looking at what apps look like today -- it seems like bunch of
rigamarole to me. Can we build mobile applications *without* design
patterns?

The idea is we could build apps in a simple way, in a similar vein as
[minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core][minimal-apis] but for mobile & maybe
one day desktop:

```csharp
public class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        int count = 0;
    
        var label = new Label
        {
            Text = "Hello, Spice ðŸŒ¶",
        };
    
        var button = new Button
        {
            Text = "Click Me",
            Clicked = _ => label.Text = $"Times: {++count}"
        };
    
        Main = new StackView { label, button };
    }
}
```

These "view" types are mostly just [POCOs][poco].

Thus you can easily write unit tests in a vanilla `net8.0` Xunit
project, such as:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Application()
{
    var app = new App();
    var label = (Label)app.Main.Children[0];
    var button = (Button)app.Main.Children[1];

    button.Clicked(button);
    Assert.Equal("Times: 1", label.Text);

    button.Clicked(button);
    Assert.Equal("Times: 2", label.Text);
}
```

The above views in a `net8.0` project are not real UI, while
`net8.0-android` and `net8.0-ios` projects get the full
implementations that actually *do* something on screen.

So for example, adding `App` to the screen on Android:

```csharp
protected override void OnCreate(Bundle? savedInstanceState)
{
    base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);

    SetContentView(new App());
}
```

And on iOS:

```csharp
var vc = new UIViewController();
vc.View.AddSubview(new App());
Window.RootViewController = vc;
```

`App` is a native view on both platforms. You just add it to an the
screen as you would any other control or view. This can be mix &
matched with regular iOS & Android UI because Spice ðŸŒ¶ views are just
native views.

## *NEW* Blazor Support

Currently, Blazor/Hybrid apps are strongly tied to .NET MAUI. The
implementation is basically working with the plumbing of the native
"web view" on each platform. So we could have implemented
`BlazorWebView` to be used in "plain" `dotnet new android` or
`dotnet new ios` apps. For now, I've migrated some of the source code
from `BlazorWebView` from .NET MAUI to Spice ðŸŒ¶, making it available
as a new control:

```csharp
public class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        Main = new BlazorWebView
        {
            HostPage = "wwwroot/index.html",
            RootComponents =
            {
                new RootComponent { Selector = "#app", ComponentType = typeof(Main) }
            },
        };
    }
}
```

From here, you can write `Index.razor` as the Blazor you know and love:

```razor
@page "/"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to your new app.
```

To arrive at Blazor web content inside iOS/Android apps:

![Screenshot of Blazor app on iOS](docs/blazor.png)

This setup might be particularly useful if you want web content to
take full control of the screen with minimal native controls. No need
for the app size / startup overhead of .NET MAUI if you don't actually
have native content?

## Scope

* No XAML. No DI. No MVVM. No MVC. No data-binding. No System.Reflection.
  * *Do we need these things?*
* Target iOS & Android only to start.
* Implement only the simplest controls.
* The native platforms do their own layout.
* Document how to author custom controls.
* Leverage C# Hot Reload for fast development.
* Measure startup time & app size.
* Profit?

Benefits of this approach are full support for [trimming][trimming]
and eventually [NativeAOT][nativeaot] if it comes to mobile one day. ðŸ˜‰

## Thoughts on .NET MAUI

.NET MAUI is great. XAML is great. Think of this idea as a "mini"
MAUI.

Spice ðŸŒ¶ will even leverage various parts of .NET MAUI:

* The iOS and Android workloads for .NET.
* The .NET MAUI "Single Project" system.
* The .NET MAUI "Asset" system, aka Resizetizer.
* Microsoft.Maui.Graphics for primitives like `Color`.

And, of course, you should be able to use Microsoft.Maui.Essentials by
opting in with `UseMauiEssentials=true`.

It is an achievement in itself that I was able to invent my own UI
framework and pick and choose the pieces of .NET MAUI that made sense
for my framework.

## Implemented Controls

* `View`: maps to `Android.Views.View` and `UIKit.View`.
* `Label`: maps to `Android.Widget.TextView` and `UIKit.UILabel`
* `Button`: maps to `Android.Widget.Button` and `UIKit.UIButton`
* `StackView`: maps to `Android.Widget.LinearLayout` and `UIKit.UIStackView`
* `Image`: maps to `Android.Widget.ImageView` and `UIKit.UIImageView`
* `Entry`: maps to `Android.Widget.EditText` and `UIKit.UITextField`
* `WebView`: maps to `Android.Webkit.WebView` and `WebKit.WKWebView`
* `BlazorWebView` extends `WebView` adding support for Blazor. Use the
  `spice-blazor` template to get started.

## Custom Controls

Let's review an implementation for `Image`.

First, you can write the cross-platform part for a vanilla `net8.0`
class library:

```csharp
public partial class Image : View
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    string _source = "";
}
```

`[ObservableProperty]` comes from the [MVVM Community
Toolkit][observable] -- I made use of it for simplicity. It will
automatically generate various `partial` methods,
`INotifyPropertyChanged`, and a `public` property named `Source`.

We can implement the control on Android, such as:

```csharp
public partial class Image
{
    public static implicit operator ImageView(Image image) => image.NativeView;

    public Image() : base(c => new ImageView(c)) { }

    public new ImageView NativeView => (ImageView)_nativeView.Value;

    partial void OnSourceChanged(string value)
    {
        // NOTE: the real implementation is in Java for performance reasons
        var image = NativeView;
        var context = image.Context;
        int id = context!.Resources!.GetIdentifier(value, "drawable", context.PackageName);
        if (id != 0) 
        {
            image.SetImageResource(id);
        }
    }
}
```

This code takes the name of an image, and looks up a drawable with the
same name. This also leverages the .NET MAUI asset system, so a
`spice.svg` can simply be loaded via `new Image { Source = "spice" }`.

Lastly, the iOS implementation:

```csharp
public partial class Image
{
    public static implicit operator UIImageView(Image image) => image.NativeView;

    public Image() : base(_ => new UIImageView { AutoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing.None }) { }

    public new UIImageView NativeView => (UIImageView)_nativeView.Value;

    partial void OnSourceChanged(string value) => NativeView.Image = UIImage.FromFile($"{value}.png");
}
```

This implementation is a bit simpler, all we have to do is call
`UIImage.FromFile()` and make sure to append a `.png` file extension
that the MAUI asset system generates.

Now, let's say you don't want to create a control from scratch.
Imagine a "ghost button":

```csharp
class GhostButton : Button
{
    public GhostButton() => NativeView.Alpha = 0.5f;
}
```

In this case, the `NativeView` property returns the underlying
`Android.Widget.Button` or `UIKit.Button` that both conveniently have
an `Alpha` property that ranges from 0.0f to 1.0f. The same code
works on both platforms!

Imagine the APIs were different, you could instead do:

```csharp
class GhostButton : Button
{
    public GhostButton
    {
#if ANDROID
        NativeView.SomeAndroidAPI(0.5f);
#elif IOS
        NativeView.SomeiOSAPI(0.5f);
#endif
    }
}
```

Accessing the native views don't require any weird design patterns.
Just `#if` as you please.

## Hot Reload

C# Hot Reload (in Visual Studio) works fine, as it does for vanilla .NET
iOS/Android apps:

![Hot Reload Demo](docs/hotreload.gif)

Note that this only works for `Button.Clicked` because the method is
invoked when you click. If the method that was changed was already
run, *something* has to force it to run again.
[`MetadataUpdateHandler`][muh] is the solution to this problem, giving
frameworks a way to "reload themselves" for Hot Reload.

Unfortunately, [`MetadataUpdateHandler`][muh] does not currently work
for non-MAUI apps in Visual Studio 2022 17.5:

```csharp
[assembly: System.Reflection.Metadata.MetadataUpdateHandler(typeof(HotReload))]

static class HotReload
{
    static void UpdateApplication(Type[]? updatedTypes)
    {
        if (updatedTypes == null)
            return;
        foreach (var type in updatedTypes)
        {
            // Do something with the type
            Console.WriteLine("UpdateApplication: " + type);
        }
    }
}
```

The above code works fine in a `dotnet new maui` app, but not a
`dotnet new spice` or `dotnet new android` application.

And so we can't add proper functionality for reloading `ctor`'s of
Spice ðŸŒ¶ views. The general idea is we could recreate the `App` class and
replace the views on screen. We could also create Android activities
or iOS view controllers if necessary.

Hopefully, we can implement this for a future release of Visual Studio.
